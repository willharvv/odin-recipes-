    <h3>Master the perfectly seared sirloin steak with this easy method, while playing with fresh herbs to enhance the flavor. The key to success: letting the meat come to room temperature before adding to the pan to ensure it cooks evenly. Rosemary and garlic give it an irresistible herby finish. For the best results, let the steak rest before serving.</h3>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound boneless top sirloin steak, trimmed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground pepper, divided</li>
      <li>4 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Let steak stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Pat dry with paper towels. Brush with oil and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook for 1 minute. Add garlic, shallots, butter and rosemary; cook, tilting the pan slightly to pool the butter and drippings on one side, for 1 minute. Use a spoon to baste the steak with the butter mixture. Flip the steak and cook, basting occasionally, until an instant-read thermometer registers 125 degrees F for medium-rare, 2 minutes more. Transfer the steak to a clean cutting board and top with the shallots, garlic and rosemary. Cover loosely with foil; let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Discard the rosemary sprig. Thinly slice the steak against the grain and transfer to a serving platter. Spoon drippings from the pan and cutting board over the steak. Season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper and garnish with more rosemary, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
